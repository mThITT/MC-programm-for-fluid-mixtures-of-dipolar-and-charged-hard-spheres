# MC Simulation Programm   

This is a Monte Carlo Simulation Programm (Fortran implementation) to compute the 
  - internal energy (with Ewald summation) for fluid mixtures of dipolar and charged hard spheres 
  - radial distribution function 
  - relative permittivity 
  - 

Note: 
  - The coupling parameter λ linearly incorporates the electrostatic pair interactions (within the acceptance criterion) to compute a λ-scaled canonical ensemble average of the internal energy
